MANUAL

Note: Due to running out of time towards the end of TINS this is grossly
unbalanced. May be possible to kill all dragons in 5 minutes - or may be
completely impossible to play right now.

dog: Quite useless, his special is an annoying barking which confuses monsters
    for a moment but also draws attention to him.

hunter: Can shoot laser bursts. His special freezes all enemies for some time.

healer: Can heal her target. Her special heals all allies fully.

knight: Melee fighter. His special draws everyones attention to him.

mage: Shoots devastating magic missiles. Her special does massive damage to
    all allies.

wolf: (prime level 2) Mostly harmless.

bat: (prime level 3) Damage done heals it so can be tough to kill.

groll: (prime level 5) annoying beasts

papa groll: can heal baby grolls so be careful

drake: (prime level 23) The first dragon.

dragon: (prime level 29) Very hard to kill.
